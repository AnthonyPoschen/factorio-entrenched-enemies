[mod-setting-description]
entrenched-enemies-base-upgrade-percent=This value determines the chance of quality for spawners and enemy turrets, if succesful the chance to level up is rolled again until reaching final level ( 0.2 == 20% chance )
entrenched-enemies-quality-upgrade-chance-per-chunk=this controls additional quality chance per chunk from origin resulting in guaranteed quality tiers of enemies. i.e value 0.04 ( 4% ) at 100 chunks away is 400% guarantees all enemies are legendary, remember this is additive to "Base Quality Level up" and the additional is reduced per tier up by the result of "1 - global percentage"
entrenched-enemies-base-spawn-multiplier=the spawn rate of units from spawners, when approaching bases and the enemies agro this value influences the spawn of a replacement unit. Higher value means faster spawn. ( 2 == 2x speed )
entrenched-enemies-base-health-multiplier=the Max HP of all spawners by this multiplier. ( 2 == 2x HP )
entrenched-enemies-base-regen-multiplier=Regen rate of all spawners health by this multiplier, ( 0.5 means half healing per second )
entrenched-enemies-demolisher-speed-multiplier=the speed demolishers move
entrenched-enemies-base-qual-minimum=change the starting level used when doing all quality modifications, increase this if you want to ensure a harder start
entrenched-enemies-base-regenerate=When qual settings change should all existing bases / worms regenerate qual values?
entrenched-enemies-demolisher-health-multiplier=Total health of demolishers
entrenched-enemies-demolisher-regen-multiplier=how fast demolishers regen HP
entrenched-enemies-demolisher-attack-range-multiplier=How far away can demolishers attack you
entrenched-enemies-demolisher-attack-cooldown-multiplier=How often do demolisher attacks allowed to attack. Lower means more often.
entrenched-enemies-demolisher-attack-variance-multiplier=How much variance exists between demolisher attacks. 0 == none, 1 == a lot, if you want the attacks perfectly predictable set this to 0
